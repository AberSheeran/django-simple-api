# Django Simple API

## About Us
***Django Simple API*** is a non-intrusive component that can help you quickly create APIs.

It's not an API framework, it's just a lightweight Django-based plugin that's very easy to learn and use.

It has two core functions:

* Automatic generation of interface documents
* Automatic validation of request parameters

To help us develop faster, we also extended support for `application/json` requests and provided some useful utility functions.
